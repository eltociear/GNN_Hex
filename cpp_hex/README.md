# The C++ part of HexAra

Subfolder include:
+ `hex_graph_game`: The C++ implementation of Shannon node-switching games for Hex. The is completely my own work.
+ `CrazyAra`: This is [https://github.com/QueensGambit/CrazyAra](https://github.com/QueensGambit/CrazyAra) modified to work with Hex graphs and GNNs.
+ `old_boost_stuff`: A previous attempt at implementing Shannon node-switching games using the boost library. Discarded because too slow and bad memory layout.
