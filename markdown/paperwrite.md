# Lets write a paper
* How do we want to break up the work?
    - Do you want to write a few sections or only supervise and guide what I write?
* Paper main focus: Generalization between board sizes or long range dependencies?
    - We should choose the title accordingly
* First person plural (We) or passive?
* HiWi: ISAMT sent me a mail to confirm my times. However: "Sie haben keinen Zugriff auf das Tool, da f√ºr Sie kein Vertrag existiert."
