+ Where can I find sensible defaults for RL training with CrazyAra / are the values in rl\_config.py or options.cpp sensible defaults
+ How does threading / batching / virtual loss work in CrazyAra?
	- Is data from different threads batched together?
	- Are multiple MCTS (for multiple games) run simultaniously during RL data generation to batch data from them together?
	- How much virtual loss can one MCTS handle without biasing the tree search too much?

+ What is the idea of wdl and ply loss?
