```
Xu et al. [6] show that the use of mean and max aggregators by themselves fail to distinguish between
neighbourhoods with identical features but with differing cardinalities, and the same applies to all the
aggregators described above. They propose the use of the sum aggregator to discriminate between
such multisets. We generalise their approach by expressing the sum aggregator as the composition of
a mean aggregator and a linear-degree amplifying scaler Samp(d) = d.
